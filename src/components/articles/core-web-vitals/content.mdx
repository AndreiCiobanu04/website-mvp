Core Web Vitals are a set of essential performance metrics that measure the user experience of a web page.
They focus on three key aspects: loading speed (Largest Contentful Paint), interactivity (First Input Delay), and visual stability (Cumulative Layout Shift).
These metrics provide insights into how quickly a page loads, how responsive it is to user interactions, and how visually stable the content remains during the loading process.

Core Web Vitals are a set of three metrics that Google uses to measure the user experience of a website. The three metrics are:

> Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

This measures the loading speed of a web page. LCP measures the time it takes for the largest element on the page, such as an image or video, to become visible to the user.

> First Input Delay (FID)

This measures the interactivity of a web page. FID measures the time it takes for a user to interact with a web page after they first click on a button or link.

> Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

This measures the visual stability of a web page. CLS measures the amount of unexpected layout shifts that occur during the loading process of a web page.

For example, let's say you visit a website and click on a link.
If it takes more than three seconds for the page to load the largest contentful paint (LCP), that website may have poor Core Web Vitals.
Similarly, if the website takes more than 100 milliseconds to respond to your click (FID), or if the website's layout unexpectedly shifts while it's loading (CLS), then that website may also have poor Core Web Vitals.

Core Web Vitals are also unique because they measure the user experience directly, rather than technical performance metrics such as server response time or network latency.
By measuring user experience, Core Web Vitals reflect the expectations and behavior of actual users, rather than just technical requirements.

  How Core Web Vitals Impact Rankings, SEO, and User Experience
</h3>
<div className="bg-black border-t border-t-gray-400 mb-5 sm:mb-10" />

Core Web Vitals are important for several reasons.
First, they are used by Google to evaluate the user experience of a website, and they have a significant impact on search engine rankings.
Websites with good Core Web Vitals are more likely to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) than those with poor Core Web Vitals.
This means that if you want your website to be visible to potential customers, you need to pay attention to your Core Web Vitals.

In today's digital landscape, delivering a seamless and satisfying user experience is paramount.
Core Web Vitals play a crucial role in this pursuit, as they directly impact a website's rankings in search engine results, influence its search engine optimization (SEO), and ultimately shape the overall user experience.
In this chapter, we will explore the profound impact that Core Web Vitals have on rankings, SEO, and user experience, highlighting the key reasons why website owners should prioritize optimizing these metrics.

> Impact on Rankings

Search engines, particularly Google, consider user experience as a vital factor in determining search rankings.
With the introduction of Core Web Vitals as a ranking signal, websites that excel in providing a positive user experience are rewarded with higher visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs).
Google has explicitly stated that Core Web Vitals will become a significant ranking factor.
Therefore, optimizing these metrics becomes essential for gaining a competitive edge and attracting organic traffic to your website.

> Impact on SEO:

Search engine optimization strategies have traditionally focused on factors like keywords, backlinks, and content relevance.
However, Core Web Vitals introduce a new dimension to SEO.
By ensuring fast loading speeds, responsive interactions, and visual stability, websites align themselves with user expectations and search engine requirements.
Websites that prioritize optimizing Core Web Vitals will have a better chance of ranking higher, attracting more organic traffic, and improving overall SEO performance.

> Impact on User Experience

Core Web Vitals directly influence the user experience and are aligned with user expectations in terms of speed, interactivity, and visual stability.
When a website loads quickly, allows smooth interactions, and provides a stable visual experience, users are more likely to engage, stay longer, and convert.
On the other hand, websites with poor Core Web Vitals frustrate users, leading to higher bounce rates, reduced engagement, and diminished conversions.
By prioritizing Core Web Vitals, website owners can enhance user satisfaction, foster positive brand perception, and ultimately drive business growth.

<div className="bg-black border-t border-t-gray-400 mb-5 sm:mb-10" />

Loading speed and visual stability are both important factors in user experience and can significantly impact user behavior on a website.
Here are some statistics that highlight the importance of these factors:

According to a study by Google, as page load time goes from 1 second to 3 seconds, the probability of a user bouncing (leaving the website) increases by 32%.
As load time increases, the bounce rate increases exponentially, with a 90% probability of bouncing if load time goes from 1 second to 5 seconds.

Another study by Google found that if a page's visual stability score (measured by the Cumulative Layout Shift, or CLS) is less than 0.1, users perceive the page as visually stable.
Pages with a CLS score above 0.25 are considered to have poor visual stability, and users are more likely to leave the page before it finishes loading.

According to a survey by Akamai, 47% of consumers expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less, and 40% of consumers will abandon a web page if it takes more than 3 seconds to load.

A study by HubSpot found that a slow-loading page can significantly impact conversion rates. For example, a page that loads in 5 seconds has a conversion rate of 1.9%, while a page that loads in 1 second has a conversion rate of 4.5%.

These statistics illustrate the importance of loading speed and visual stability in user experience, and highlight the potential impact that slow loading times or shifting screens can have on user behavior. By improving these factors, website owners can improve user engagement and ultimately drive more conversions.

While Core Web Vitals serve as crucial indicators of website performance and user experience, there are other metrics that play a significant role in determining website rankings.

> Time to First Byte (TTFB)

This measures the time it takes for the server to respond to a request from the user's browser.
TTFB is an important indicator of server performance, and a slow TTFB can indicate issues such as network latency, slow database queries, or server overload.

> Time to Interactive (TTI)

This measures the time it takes for a web page to become fully interactive.
TTI is similar to First Input Delay (FID), but it measures the time it takes for the page to become fully interactive, rather than just the time it takes for the first input to be processed.

> Total Blocking Time (TBT)

This measures the amount of time during page load when the user is unable to interact with the page.
TBT is a more comprehensive measure of interactivity than FID, as it takes into account all blocking tasks, not just the first input.

> Speed Index

This measures the visual completeness of a web page during the loading process.
Speed Index calculates the time it takes for the visual elements of a web page to appear, and it provides a score that reflects the overall visual performance of the page.

These metrics, along with Core Web Vitals, provide a comprehensive view of the user experience of a web page.
By tracking these metrics and improving them over time, website owners can improve the performance of their websites, provide a better user experience, and ultimately rank higher in search engine results pages.
